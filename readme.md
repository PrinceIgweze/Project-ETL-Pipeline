# Automated ETL Pipeline Project â€“ Prince Igweze

## Task

Company XYZ Services Limited keeps a catalogue of their financial statements in Excel sheets every month. These financial statements contain annual dollar amounts paid by month for various sub-categories across 13 provinces in Canada.

## Methodology 
 
Using Python, I designed a script to automatically **Extract**, **Transform**, and **Load** (ETL) the dollar amounts for each sub-category across all provinces. The data is aggregated into a single Excel sheet and loaded into an SQL database for further analysis.

### Key Steps:

1. **Extract**: Retrieve data from monthly Excel sheets.
2. **Transform**: Aggregate and clean the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
3. **Load**: Insert the transformed data into a consolidated Excel file and an SQL database.
